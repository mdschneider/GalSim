"""@file optics.py
Module containing the optical PSF generation routines.

Most of the contents of this file are just functions; they are used to generate galsim.OpticalPSF()
class instances (one of the GSObjects, also in this file).

Most methods in this file (except for the OpticalPSF class itself) are solely of use to developers
for generating arrays that may be useful in defining GSObjects with an optical component.  They will
not therefore be used in a typical image simulation workflow: users will find most of what they need
simply using the OpticalPSF class.

Glossary of key terms used in function names:

PSF = point spread function

OTF = optical transfer function = FT{PSF}

MTF = modulation transfer function = |FT{PSF}|

PTF = phase transfer function = p, where OTF = MTF * exp(i * p)

Wavefront = the amplitude and phase of the incident light on the telescope pupil, encoded as a
complex number. The OTF is the autocorrelation function of the wavefront.

class OpticalPSF(GSObject):
    """A class describing aberrated PSFs due to telescope optics.  Its underlying implementation
    uses an InterpolatedImage to characterize the profile.

    Input aberration coefficients are assumed to be supplied in units of wavelength, and correspond
    to the Zernike polynomials in the Noll convention defined in
    Noll, J. Opt. Soc. Am. 66, 207-211(1976).  For a brief summary of the polynomials, refer to
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zernike_polynomials#Zernike_polynomials.

    You can also optionally specify that the secondary mirror (or prime focus cage, etc.) are held
    by some number of support struts.  These are taken to be rectangular obscurations extending from
    the outer edge of the pupil to the outer edge of the obscuration disk (or the pupil center if
    `obscuration = 0.`).  You can specify how many struts there are (evenly spaced in angle), how
    thick they are as a fraction of the pupil diameter, and what angle they start at relative to
    the positive y direction.

    Initializes `optical_psf` as an OpticalPSF instance.

    @param lam_over_diam    Lambda / telescope diameter in the physical units adopted for `scale`
                            (user responsible for consistency).
    @param defocus          Defocus in units of incident light wavelength. [default: 0]
    @param astig1           Astigmatism (like e2) in units of incident light wavelength. 
                            [default: 0]
    @param astig2           Astigmatism (like e1) in units of incident light wavelength.
                            [default: 0]
    @param coma1            Coma along y in units of incident light wavelength. [default: 0]
    @param coma2            Coma along x in units of incident light wavelength. [default: 0]
    @param trefoil1         Trefoil (one of the arrows along y) in units of incident light
                            wavelength. [default: 0]
    @param trefoil2         Trefoil (one of the arrows along x) in units of incident light
                            wavelength. [default: 0]
    @param spher            Spherical aberration in units of incident light wavelength.
                            [default: 0]
    @param aberrations      Optional keyword, to pass in a list, tuple, or NumPy array of
                            aberrations in units of incident light wavelength (ordered according to
                            the Noll convention), rather than passing in individual values for each
                            individual aberration.  Currently GalSim supports aberrations from
                            defocus through third-order spherical (`spher`), which are aberrations
                            4-11 in the Noll convention, and hence `aberrations` should be an
                            object of length 12, with the first four numbers being ignored, the 5th
                            (index 4) being defocus, and so on through index 11 corresponding to
                            `spher`. [default: None]
    @param circular_pupil   Adopt a circular pupil?  [default: True]
    @param obscuration      Linear dimension of central obscuration as fraction of pupil linear
                            dimension, [0., 1.). [default: 0]
    @param interpolant      Either an Interpolant2d (or Interpolant) instance or a string indicating
                            which interpolant should be used.  Options are 'nearest', 'sinc', 
                            'linear', 'cubic', 'quintic', or 'lanczosN' where N should be the 
                            integer order to use. [default: galsim.Quintic()]
    @param oversampling     Optional oversampling factor for the InterpolatedImage. Setting 
                            `oversampling < 1` will produce aliasing in the PSF (not good).
                            Usually `oversampling` should be somewhat larger than 1.  1.5 is 
                            usually a safe choice.  [default: 1.5]
    @param pad_factor       Additional multiple by which to zero-pad the PSF image to avoid folding
                            compared to what would be employed for a simple Airy.  Note that
                            `pad_factor` may need to be increased for stronger aberrations, i.e.
                            those larger than order unity.  [default: 1.5]  
    @param suppress_warning If `pad_factor` is too small, the code will emit a warning telling you
                            its best guess about how high you might want to raise it.  However,
                            you can suppress this warning by using `suppress_warning=True`.
                            [default: False]
    @param max_size         Set a maximum size of the internal image for the optical PSF profile
                            in arcsec.  Sometimes the code calculates a rather large image size
                            to describe the optical PSF profile.  If you will eventually be 
                            drawing onto a smallish postage stamp, you might want to save some
                            CPU time by setting `max_size` to be the size of your postage stamp.
                            [default: None]
    @param flux             Total flux of the profile. [default: 1.]
    @param nstruts          Number of radial support struts to add to the central obscuration.
                            [default: 0]
    @param strut_thick      Thickness of support struts as a fraction of pupil diameter.
                            [default:`0.05]
    @param strut_angle      Angle made between the vertical and the strut starting closest to it,
                            defined to be positive in the counter-clockwise direction; must be an
                            Angle instance. [default: 0. * galsim.degrees]
    @param gsparams         An optional GSParams argument.  See the docstring for GSParams for
                            details. [default: None]
